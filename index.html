      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p> my name is Brent i was born and raised in Auckland. Some of the values ive been thinnking about is being patient cause this is all new to me and to be okay with not knowing much and also Growth to learn not only the tech side of the course but also to grow on my people skills.
          The reason why i chose devacademy was because Ive only done Labour related jobs in the past and was lucky enough to make it to my brothers partners graduation at devacademy in 2021 and was inpired to join and im really happy i did because everyone is welcoming
