    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

    <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
    
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is all about understanding and managing our feelings and the feelings of others. It's like having a superpower that helps us communicate better, make friends, and handle tough situations.
      It means being able to recognize when we feel happy, sad, angry, or scared and knowing how to express those feelings in a healthy way. It also means being able to understand how other people are feeling and being 
      kind and supportive to them when they need it. Having good emotional intelligence can make us happier, healthier, and more successful in life!

      On the other hand, EQ, or emotional intelligence, is all about understanding and managing our feelings and the feelings of others. It's not about how smart we are in a traditional sense, but about how well we can communicate, get along with others, and handle tough situations.
