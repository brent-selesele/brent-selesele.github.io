      <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
      
      
      <h4>What is my long term goal or career pathway?
      </h4>

      <p>My long term career pathway is to get a full-time job in the Information Technology Industry - ideally as a web developer.</p>

      <h4>A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
      </h4>
      <p>One of my strengths for learning is my ability to perservere although at times the self doubt talk has tried to creep in, Im still focused on seeing this learning journey through.

        One limitation of mine is confidence there has been alot of self doubt that has come around more so now because its all new to me.
        </p>

        <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think the core skill Im looking forward to developing the most during my time at Dev Academy would be self-confidence. It's a very important skill that will benefit me more anot just with dev academy but also just life in general.
        </p>
        
        <h4>A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h4>

        <p>So far im still trying to work on my time management using timeboxes but it hasnt quiet gone to plan so far but the more i continue to use it the more effective it will become moving forward.
        </p>

        <h4>When it comes to managing myself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives, It's important that I:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Be respectful and professsional,
        </li>
        <li>Take responsibility,
        </li>
        <li>Communicate effectively.
        </li>
        <li>Be a team player and interact more.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4>A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way
      </h4>

      <p>If I am stuck on something for more than 15 minutes and google isnt helping -ill take a little 5 min break and try again if it doesnt work I'll ask one of my facilitators. But there is a point where if youve spent to much time on something move on and come back to it later.</p>

      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>

      <p>I expect that the Facilitation team is able to help me with any problems / issues I may run into during the course. Not just tech related but also in terms of core / human skills.
      </p>

      <h4>Scheduling / Commitments</h4>

      <p>In terms of scheduling and commitments i am a full time student .The only commitment outside of this course is my daughter being a solo father but i have made and can make arrangements if the time comes.</p>
