    <h2>Identity-values</h2>


    <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now?</h4>
      
      <p class="intro-text">When i was running my freezer room production when i first started we had alot of older gentlemen in the back doing most of the heavy lifting and realised alot of the younger fitter people were located in the less physical areas of our department so i re-arranged the department and saw a more effective workflow.
        </p>

     <h4>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>
     
     <p>Being Samoan but born in New Zealand has its own challenges we were brought up in chruch and it just became routine but as i grew older and experienced the world a bit more you realise there is many other religions out there that have the same or similar teachings and has taught me to be more open and understanding to others around me.</p>

     <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey?</h4>

     <p>My strength is my ability to connect with people on a personal level and being empathetic. I feel this will support me on my journey because we are apart of a cohert with people from different beleifs and backgrounds.
    </p>

     <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>

     <p>Just limiting belief in myself as everything is brand new to me right now but i feel as though it will improve as we progress into more of our learning journey.
    </p>

     <h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?
    </h4>

     <p>I worked security and bounced at certain night clubs for a number of years. There were always issues with intoxication and being clear when dealing with certain patrons. We found that as long as communication was clear on the radio we were able to get a respond team there faster and just documenting incidents after every night we were able to see which incident occured more and we were able to put strategies in place to minimize them.
