    <h2>Problem-SoLving</h2>

    <h4>Were blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
    
    <p>
      a simple problem where i was blocked was during the gradebook questions i had a typo error i had added an extra s to a few of the studentName (studentsName) but i was thinking that something was wrong with the code.
      It was fustrating at the time but also a relief to know that i was on the right track. I learnt to not doubt myself that i am on the right track and not to overthink which is something that im working on. 
  
    </p>
    

    <h4>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
      
    <p>
      i still feel as though i have a bit of work to do in this area but im glad to know its all heading in the right direction. 
    </p>

    <h4>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h4>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Pseudocode</b> = Need to use it more as it quite useful.</li>
    <li><b>Trying something</b> = im confident with just giving something a go as it gives me something to work off so im not just staring aimlessly at the screen.</li>
    <li><b>Rubber ducky method</b> = i think this step will come alot easier the more i learn.</li>
    <li><b>Reading error messages</b> = semi confident with this.</li>
    <li><b>Console.logging</b> = didnt use this much as im unsure on how to do so.</li>
    <li><b>Googling</b> = very confident google's the best.</li>
    <li><b>Asking your peers for help</b> = still learning to utilize this.</li>
    <li><b>Asking coaches for help</b> = still learning to utilize this more as our coaches are both lovely and informative.</li>
    <li><b>Improving your process with reflection</b> = this has been helpful with retaining some of the things we've learnt.</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h4> Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so?</h4>

    <p>
      There have been a few times where i was reluctant to ask for help. But didnt because of my closed mindset and being to hard on myself thinking i sholud just know it.
