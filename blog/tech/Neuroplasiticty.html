    <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>

    <h4>1.Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
      Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
      What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging?
      </h4>
    
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity means that our brains can change and adapt throughout our lives. Knowing about neuroplasticity can help us recover from brain injury, improve our memory and learning abilities, maintain good mental health, and slow down the effects of aging on our brains.
here is a link to an article written by James Clear<click><a href= "https://buffer.com/resources/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset/">"click Here"</a></click>i found this to be more engaging because ive heard the saying "confidence is just displayed talent" before from coaches in the past as well as some high profile athletes. 
    </p>
    

    <h4>2.Research Growth Mindset
      .Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
      In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
      Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h4>
      
    <p>
      Having a growth mindset means believing that with effort and perseverance, you can improve your abilities and intelligence. It's important because it helps you overcome obstacles, learn from your mistakes, and ultimately achieve your goals. To integrate growth mindset into my learning journey,i need to focus on embracing challenges, being positive about failure, and staying curious and open to learning i kept seeing this diagram in most of the growth mindset articles and found it very self explanatory on the two mindsets. 
    </p>

    <h4>3.Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy?</h4>

    <p>
      Neuroplasticity and growth mindset mean that we can train our brains to learn new things and improve our abilities over time. By embracing challenges and having a positive attitude towards learning, we can create a plan for achieving our goals and be open to feedback and adjusting our approach as needed. This will be very helpful for both our learning plan ans strategy.
