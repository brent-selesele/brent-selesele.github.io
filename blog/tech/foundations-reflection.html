    <h2>Foundation Reflections</h2>


    <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
      
      <p class="intro-text">Ive learnt the importance of positive self talk all throughout foundations.
        Ive also been able to identify the moments where i do have a closed mindset.
        Id read a book on emotional intelligence towards the end of last year it was finally good be able to go over it again as its extremely important.
        </p>

     <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
     
     <p>Values, empathy, and self-awareness are important for programming. They help programmers make good decisions, understand users, work well in teams, and improve themselves.</p>

     <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

     <p>Just about its importance to your overall mental health.</p>

     <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
     

     <p>i found these were alot easier then the technical challenges but one of the challenging parts was when i had to write about me im still on a journey of self development and this is a work in progress.</p>

     <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>

     <p>Because it is just as important as the technical skills.
    </p>

     <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>

     <p>No i find it useful and look forward to learning more about core skills during bootcamp.</p>
